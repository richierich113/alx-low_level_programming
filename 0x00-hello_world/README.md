The 0-preprocessor script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file named c.
The 1-compiler script compiles a C file but does not link. The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .o instead of .c. Example: if the C file is main.c, the output file should be main.o.
